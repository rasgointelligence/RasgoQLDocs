# Data Warehouses

RasgoQL is built to run on your existing Data Warehouse. The benefits of this design are:

* data never leaves your secure environment
* all processing happens remotely in the cloud, allowing users to interact with massive datasets on laptops and VMs
* permissions are handled by your existing data access policy

### Supported Data Warehouses

* Snowflake
* BigQuery
* Redshift
* Postgres
* MySQL

To request support for a specific Data Warehouse drop a comment in the Rasgo [slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/rasgousergroup/shared\_invite/zt-nytkq6np-ANEJvbUSbT2Gkvc8JICp3g).
